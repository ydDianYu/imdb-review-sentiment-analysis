# imdb-review-sentiment-analysis
Within this ongoing project, I used TensorFlow to implement neural network models that performs sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews. I experimented with word embeddings and LSTM architectures and arrived at a model with around 0.88 accuracy.

The dataset and more information about it can be found here: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
